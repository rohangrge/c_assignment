program to mimic the passwd cmd on linux
this program is to mimic the command passwd which is on linux and used to change the passwd of the user.
This program takes into account the shadow passwd files and includes the use of environment variables,tested on windows but mostly applicable
on both windows and linux in common 
The program uses basic functions pertaining to string and file handling in particular
The program now is separated into multiple files 
A make file has been created to execute them in to a single executable P
there is an environment variable which is PFILE 
which is referring to the PFILE folder which is present in the program folder
Major improvements with make file making the code more readable as it is now separated into multiple programs 
better use to the make file with an understanding of target and dependencies
